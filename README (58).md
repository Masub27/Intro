[https://www.ovgu.de/unimagdeburg/en/International/Incoming+_+Ways+to+the+University/International+Students/Organizing+Your+Stay/Enrolment-p-48644.html]()

 ## Step 4

 After you have already shared your valid residential address in Magdeburg then only your student ID card will be sent to you by post. You can find more information under the following link:

# Understanding myOVGU portal


Please use myOVGU portal

![](https://github.com/Masub27/Intro/blob/main/Screenshot%2034.png?raw=true)

for updated information about the status of your enrolment and information about all the activities including “Locking”. The link for myOVGU is given below: https://myovgu.ovgu.de/qisserver/pages/cs/sys/portal/hisinoneStartPage.faces


    {{1}}


> Important Note Regarding Personal Access to the MyOVGU Portal.





    {{2}}


* Personal access to the MyOVGU portal is extremely important and should be set up without delay!

* This is especially relevant for students who applied through an agency. If you do not yet have access, please contact your agency directly to obtain your login details.

* Once you have access, immediately change your university account password to prevent any third party (such as the agency) from accessing your personal information.

* When the new re-registration period begins, it is crucial to familiarize yourself with the “Holds” section in the portal and to understand the information correctly.

* If the information is displayed in German, please use a reliable translation tool.


    {{3}}


An example of locking is shown in the image given below:Example:![](https://github.com/Masub27/Intro/blob/main/42.jpg?raw=true)
For Summer Semester 2025, the insurance status report (M10) is missing. This must be submitted immediately to enrolment@ovgu.de
![](https://github.com/Masub27/Intro/blob/main/43.jpg?raw=true)





    {{4}}


* Additionally, the current address for Summer Semester 2025 is missing.

* For Winter Semester 2025, the locking is due to unpaid tuition fees.

    {{5}}

 
* Given above the most common reasons for delays or issues with re-registration. Please check your status in the portal regularly and respond promptly.
 * Only when all requirements are met will you be officially re-registered for the next semester – and be able to download your certificate of enrolment for all official purposes.


    {{6}}

After you have already shared your valid residential address in Magdeburg then only your student ID card will be sent to you by post. You can find more information under the following link:
