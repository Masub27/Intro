## Markdown-Syntax

                           --{{0}}--
This section is intended to give a brief overview on the basic Markdown syntax
elements. The only difference to common Markdown at this point is, that you can
define meta-information such as author, language, voice, etc. within a
HTML-comment at the beginning of every document. We will describe all of these
elements in more detail in [section: Macros](#macros). All of these `macros`
start with a single word, which is followed by a colon. If you require more
space, like for `comment:` or `link:` you can use multiple lines, but every
following line has to start with an indentation.

Initial LIA-comment-tag for basic definitions:
