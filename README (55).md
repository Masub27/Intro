RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for the R programming language. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing code, analyzing data, and creating reports. RStudio helps students, researchers, and data analysts work more efficiently with R.
It includes a script editor, a console for running code, a workspace to view your variables, and a plots window to visualize your data. With RStudio, you can write R code, run it, and instantly see the results.
Whether you're doing statistical analysis, creating graphs, or building machine learning models, RStudio is a powerful tool to support your work.

Initial LIA-comment-tag for basic definitions:


```r

# Load required packages
library(readr)  # For reading CSV files
library(here)   # For project-relative paths

# Set working directory to project root (not always necessary with RProject, but good practice)
setwd(here::here())

# Read the CSV file
ai_competency_data <- read_csv("2024_25_Quant_Example_Data_AI_Competency.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(ai_competency_data)

# Display basic information about the dataset
glimpse(ai_competency_data)

```
# R project

An R Project is a way to organize your work in RStudio. It keeps all your files, code, and data in one place.
When you create an R Project, RStudio sets up a special folder. This folder contains everything related to your analysis, including scripts, datasets, and output files.
Using R Projects helps you stay organized and makes it easier to share your work with others. It also sets the working directory automatically, so you donâ€™t need to change file paths each time.
R Projects are especially useful for larger tasks like data analysis, research projects, or academic assignments.

Here is example of r Project

```r

# Load required packages
library(readr)  # For reading CSV files
library(here)   # For project-relative paths

# Set working directory to project root (not always necessary with RProject, but good practice)
setwd(here::here())

# Read the CSV file
ai_competency_data <- read_csv("2024_25_Quant_Example_Data_AI_Competency.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(ai_competency_data)

# Display basic information about the dataset
glimpse(ai_competency_data)

```
