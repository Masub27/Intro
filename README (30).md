> Important Note Regarding Personal Access to the MyOVGU Portal.

    {{5}}


* Personal access to the MyOVGU portal is extremely important and should be set up without delay!

* This is especially relevant for students who applied through an agency. If you do not yet have access, please contact your agency directly to obtain your login details.

* Once you have access, immediately change your university account password to prevent any third party (such as the agency) from accessing your personal information.

* When the new re-registration period begins, it is crucial to familiarize yourself with the “Holds” section in the portal and to understand the information correctly.

* If the information is displayed in German, please use a reliable translation tool.

* An example of a common hold is shown in the attached image.

* Please read the information carefully and pay attention to differences between semesters.

    {{6}}


Example:![](https://github.com/Masub27/Intro/blob/main/42.jpg?raw=true)

![](https://github.com/Masub27/Intro/blob/main/43.jpg?raw=true)

    {{7}}


* Additionally, the current address for Summer Semester 2025 is missing.

* For Winter Semester 2025, the locking is due to unpaid tuition fees.

    {{8}}

 
* Given above the most common reasons for delays or issues with re-registration. Please check your status in the portal regularly and respond promptly.
